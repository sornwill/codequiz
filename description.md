## Code Quiz

    Goal : Create a web quiz with a timer and store highscores at end. 

        1 . Create HTML to fit a quiz
        2 . Create Questions
        3 . Indicate if answers are correct/incorrect
        4 . Add a timer
        5 . If incorrect, subtract time
        6 . count scores
        7 . store scores then output at end

    Pressing start will begin quiz. Then you will go through a series of 5 questions. For each wrong answer the time will be subtracted by 10. 
    Once finished, the index will show you your final result. Then a option to input your name along with your score under the Scores section. 

    The longest part for me was setting up the script.js so the questions would show correctly and run through them.
